Objectives:
You have to do following tasks in this assigned
1. Define a V set to separate skin region from the background using 8-connectivity 
based CCA
2. Define new groups of V sets where you can now further differentiate between 
different layers of skin 
3. Compute Dice co-efficient. For this, count number of True and false pixels. True 
pixels are those where your label and label given in masks of respective image are 
overlapping and false pixels are those where they are not overlapping. Normalize this 
by diving with total number of true pixels given in original mask.
